Info
- 
The Forge Relocation FMP Plugin is an extension that allows proper movement of FMP tiles.  It is not recommended that
you move FMP tiles without it. Features include the ability to move multipart tiles correctly, being able to 
place parts inside frame blocks, and using covers to prevent sticks, and using panels to add solidity to sides.

It also serves as a test case of how other mod authors could use the API to add custom tile movers in case the default
one does not work properly with their blocks.
